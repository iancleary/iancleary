### Time appropriate greetings, my name is Ian Cleary.

🙋🏻‍(♂️ Pronouns: https://pronoun.is/he.)

I’m a systems engineer based in Phoenix. I work on satellite payloads 🛰️ at [@Viasat](https://github.com/viasat), where we are developing technologies that empower regular people to connect on their own terms.

My website is at https://iancleary.me, which is where I post articles and resources, and is where you can find out more about me.

Fun fact: I play Underwater Hockey! Checkout a great YouTube video I'm featured in: "[It's Hockey, But Underwater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAukrpTEvZA)".

Stay safe and drink water! 👋
